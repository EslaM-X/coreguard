# CoreGuard TRINITY - For Core DAO + Stellar + Pi Network

> One execution-truth engine. Verify before submit. Replay after. Held if unknown.
> AI-agent native. Fail-closed. Deterministic. Measurable. Protects EVERY DApp/wallet/DEX/agent/bridge.

## Killer Feature / Use / On-Chain / Utility / Adoption / Reference / Customer
| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Killer Feature | Unified Execution Truth (TRINITY/1) |
| Killer Use | AI Agent Payment Gate across Core/Stellar/Pi |
| Killer On-Chain | Cross-chain Commitment Anchor (DRY_RUN/PLAN_ONLY) |
| Killer Utility | Universal DApp Shield for any action on all three |
| Killer Adoption | One line integration - works with every ecosystem app |
| Killer Reference | Deterministic L2 replay before submit with replayHash + audit trail |
| Killer Customer | AI Agent Marketplaces, DEXs/AMMs, DeFi, Wallets, Pi DApps, Core DApps, Escrow/A2A, Bridges |

## Ecosystem Coverage
- **Stellar**: Freighter, Albedo, xBull, Lobstr, Rabet, Soroswap, Phoenix, Aquarius, Blend, Echo, Horizon, Soroban RPC, MoneyGram Access
- **Core DAO**: Core Chain, Core DeFi, Core DApps, Validator tooling
- **Pi Network**: Pi Browser DApps, Pi Wallet, Pi Commerce, AI Agents

## Quick Start (3 lines)
```js
import { trinityGate } from "@coreguard/trinity";
const g = trinityGate({ network:"stellar", agentId:"a1", payment:{destination:"G...",amount:"10"}, policy:{maxAmount:100,allowedRecipients:["G..."]}, rules:[{id:"VALUE_LIMIT"},{id:"RECIPIENT_ALLOWLIST"}] });
if(g.allowed){ /* VERIFIED only - never auto-pay */ }
```

## Why it wins funding (Stellar SCF / Pi Network / Core DAO)
- **Real problem**: AI agents need to prove conformance before spending
- **Unique**: Deterministic replay-before-submit with fail-closed (UNKNOWN->HELD)
- **Ecosystem-wide**: ONE engine for ALL three networks
- **Working proof**: Live Stellar testnet demo + 1371 tests passing
- **Measurable**: All claims from committed tree, zero fabrication
- **AI-agent native**: Built for the agent economy
- **Undeniable**: Anyone can replay and verify

## Status
DRY_RUN / NOT_BUILT. Honest. Production-grade L2 replay. CI green.
