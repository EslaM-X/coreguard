## Budget ($50,000)

| Category | Amount | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Engineering & security | $25,000 | Soroban contract, SDK integration, testing |
| Stellar integrations | $10,000 | Freighter, DEX, cross-border |
| Independent security review | $5,000 | Third-party audit |
| Infrastructure & testing | $5,000 | RPC nodes, hosting, monitoring |
| Developer adoption & docs | $5,000 | Documentation, examples, tutorials |
| **Total** | **$50,000** | Within Integration Track |

---

## Team

- **Founder**: EslaM-X (CoreGuard Global)
- **Post-funding**: 1 Soroban engineer (contract), 1 security reviewer (contract)
- **Current**: Solo founder

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Soroban mainnet fees high | Test on testnet first, optimize WASM |
| No external users | Focus on 1 DApp integration |
| Team size | Solo founder + contractors |
| Competition | Focus on unique value (conformance) |
