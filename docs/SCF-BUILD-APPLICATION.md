## Track: Integration Track

## Project: CoreGuard Global — Verifiable Execution Truth Layer for Stellar

---

### 1. Project Overview

CoreGuard is a verifiable execution truth layer. It produces independently verifiable evidence of whether execution conformed to what was authorized — not just whether it looked safe.

**What we're building on Stellar:**
- Intent-to-execution conformance verification
- Soroban commitment anchor (MAINNET deployed — `CCKA2GYVILX7YZVSXGVIHOPNLTRBBF2SSWKBTQBIE7M67N5N2QMMXPSP` — and the first anchor CALL EXECUTED/INVOKED, owner-authorized, 2026-11-06)
- Freighter wallet integration
- Soroban DEX gating (swap/path payment/liquidity verification)
- AI agent payment gates
- Cross-border payment verification

**Current status (honest):**
- Soroban commitment anchor: MAINNET deployed (`CCKA2GYVILX7YZVSXGVIHOPNLTRBBF2SSWKBTQBIE7M67N5N2QMMXPSP`) + first anchor CALL EXECUTED — owner-authorized `commit(proofId, commitment)` INVOKED (tx `69044807410f65027c1227f4e525ad83f23a6cb1a2bb79790d82849c5dbc9fec`, ledger 65,337,373; on-chain read-back `{hash, seq}` exact; artifact `docs/evidence/stellar-soroban-commit-executed.json`)
- Mainnet: 1 test transaction executed (0.1 XLM → SDF)
- DEX gating: Built and tested (9 tests passing)
- AI agent payments: Built (plan only, not executed)
- Freighter: Wrapper built, not tested end-to-end

---

### 2. Ecosystem Value

**Problem**: Stellar has 8M+ accounts and processes billions in cross-border payments, but there is NO tool that verifies whether execution conformed to authorization. Payment failures are hard to diagnose. Compliance teams trust, not verify.

**Solution**: CoreGuard on Stellar provides:
1. **Pre-execution verification** — verify before you submit
2. **Execution conformance** — compare authorized intent vs actual execution
3. **Deterministic replay** — independently replay after submission
4. **Fail-closed** — UNKNOWN → HELD (never silently pass)
5. **AI agent gates** — verify AI agent payments before execution
6. **DEX gating** — verify swaps, path payments, liquidity provision

**Unique value**: No other project on Stellar provides verifiable execution-conformance evidence. We are the only tool that produces independently replayable proof of conformance.

### 8. Why Integration Track?

We are incorporating existing Stellar building blocks:
- **Soroban** — commitment anchor contract
- **Freighter** — wallet signing
- **Stellar SDK** — transaction building
- **Horizon** — account management
- **Soroban RPC** — contract invocation

We have existing significant traction on Core DAO and are ready to build fast on Stellar.
